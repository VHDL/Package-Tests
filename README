This repo is intended to contain VHDL tests to enable full stimulus of default
packages sourcecode.  This will enable venders to test against a known set of
tests which fully cover each standards package source code.


Current state:  WIP

std_pkgs_08 directory is the initial checkin of code used to fully cover
numeric_std and numeric_bit packages.  Some tests are targeted at other packages
but they are incomplete.  std_pkgs_08 directory contains scripts which are
dependent on Metrics simulation infrustructure and will be replaced by generic
scripts.  They were included to provide a guide of what was done before so
that there is a reference.

The test set is going to implement a generic system to regress it starting with
GHDL.  An attempt to make the scripting able to be adapted for other tools.
