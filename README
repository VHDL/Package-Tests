This repo is intended to contain VHDL tests to enable full stimulus of default
2008 packages source code.  This will enable venders to test against a known set of
tests which fully cover each standards package source code.


Scripts to run tests under GHDL are now available.
See the README file in the std_pkgs_08 directory
