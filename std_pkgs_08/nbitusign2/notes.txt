This test has several issues.

Aldec will not get past 
    assert STD_ULOGIC_VECTOR'("0001") <= 2
                                         report "Test STD_C.17.1 failing."
                                         severity failure;


GHDL with some switches will run completely.

Dsim finds vector size diff.
